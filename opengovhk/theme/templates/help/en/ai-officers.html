<dt id="top">I just got here from bottom of a request, what is going on? <a href="#top">#</a> </dt>

<dd><p>Opengov.hk is a service run to help ordinary members
of the public make requests under the Code on Access to Information, and easily track and share the responses.</p>

<p>The request you received was made by someone using opengov.hk. You can
simply reply to the request as you would any other request from an individual.
The only difference is that your response will be automatically published on
the Internet.
</p>
<p>If you have privacy or other concerns, please read the answers below.
You might also like to read the <a
href="{% url 'help-about' %}">introduction to opengov.hk</a> to find out more about what
the site does from the point of view of a user. You can also search the
site to find the authority that you work for, and view the status of
any requests made using the site.

<p>Finally, we welcome comments and
thoughts from AI officers, so please <a href="mailto:contact@opengov.hk">get in touch</a>.

<dt id="responses">Why are you publishing responses to requests? <a href="#responses">#</a> </dt>

<dd>We think there are lots of benefits. Most importantly it will encourage the
public to be more interested and involved in the work of government. We
also hope that it will reduce the number of duplicate requests on any
subject that a public body will receive. Given that responses to Code on Access to Information requests contain public information, which anybody could easily request
again from the public authority, we think there should be no reason not to
publish it widely.
</dd>

<dt id="realpeople">Are the people making requests real people? <a href="#realpeople">#</a> </dt>

<dd>Yes. For the purposes of keeping track of responses we use
computer-generated email addresses for each request. However, before
they can send a request, each user must register on the site with a
unique email address that we then verify. You can search this site and
find a page listing all requests that each person has made.
</dd>

<dt id="email_only">An email isn't a sufficient address for a request! <a href="#email_only">#</a> </dt>

<dd>Yes it is.
</dd>

<dt id="vexatious">Aren't you making lots of vexatious requests? <a href="#vexatious">#</a> </dt>

<dd><p>We are not making any requests. We are sending requests on
behalf of our users, who are real people making the requests. </p>
<p>Look at it like this - if lots of different people made requests from
different Hotmail email addresses, then you would not think that Microsoft were
making vexatious requests. It is exactly the same if lots of requests are made
via opengov.hk. Moreover, since all requests are public it is much easier
for you to see if one of our users is making vexatious requests. </p>
</dd>

<dt id="spam_problems">I can see a request on WhatDoTheyKnow, but we never got it by email!<a href="#spam_problems">#</a> </dt>

<dd><p>If a request appears on the site, then we have attempted to send it to
the authority by email. Any delivery failure messages will automatically
appear on the site. <a
href="mailto:contact@opengov.hk">Contact us</a> if there is a better address we can
use.</p>
<p>Requests are sometimes not delivered because they are quietly removed by
"spam filters" in the IT department of the authority. Authorities can make
sure this doesn't happen by asking their IT departments to "whitelist"
any email from <strong>@opengov.hk</strong>.
If you <a href="mailto:contact@opengov.hk">ask us</a> we will resend any request,
and/or give technical details of delivery so an IT department can chase
up what happened to the message.
</p>

<dt id="days">How do you calculate the deadline shown on request pages?<a href="#days">#</a> </dt>

<dd>
<p>Don't worry too much about this. The Code says that
<blockquote>
The target response times set out in [...] 
the Code should be regarded as upper limits.  Information should always be provided 
as quickly as possible and responses will therefore, in many cases, be made well 
within these target times.
</blockquote>
If you think you will need some extra time to respond to a request, just tell the requester as much, explaining in a sentence or two why that is the case. They will appreciate it, and the amout of hard work you do.
</p>
</dd>


<dt id="names">Why do you publish the names of civil servants and the text of emails? <a href="#names">#</a> </dt>

<dd>We consider what officers or servants do in the course of their employment
to be public information. We will only remove content in exceptional
circumstances, see our <a href="{% url 'help-privacy' %}#public_servant_takedown">take down policy</a>.
</dd>

<dt id="mobiles">Do you publish email addresses or mobile phone numbers? <a href="#mobiles">#</a> </dt>

<dd><p>To prevent spam, we automatically remove most emails and some mobile numbers from
responses to requests.  Please <a href="contact@opengov.hk">contact us</a> if we've
missed one.
For technical reasons we don't always remove them from attachments, such as certain PDFs.</p>
<p>If you need to know what an address was that we've removed, please <a
  href="contact@opengov.hk">get in touch with us</a>. Occasionally, an email address
forms an important part of a response and we will post it up in an obscured
form in an annotation.
</dd>

<dt id="copyright"><a name="commercial"></a>What is your policy on copyright of documents?<a href="#copyright">#</a> </dt>

<dd>The Code on Access to Information is "applicant blind", so anyone in the
world can request the same document and get a copy of it.

If you think our making a document available on the internet infringes your
copyright, you may <a href="contact@opengov.hk">contact us</a> and ask us
to take it down.  However, to save tax payers' money by preventing duplicate
requests, and for good public relations, we'd advise you not to do that.
</dd>
