<h1>Unhappy about the response you got?</h1>

<p>If ...</p>
<ul>
<li>You didn't get a reply within the target time (normally 10 or 21 calendar days)<strong>or</strong></li>
<li>You did not get all of the information that you requested <strong>or</strong></li>
<li>Your request was refused, but without a reason valid under the Code</li>
</ul>

<p>... you can</p>

<ol>
<li>Ask for an <strong>internal review</strong> at the department.</li>
<li>If that doesn't help, complain to the <strong>Ombudsman</strong>.</li>
<li>Either way, also <strong>use other means</strong> to answer your question.</li>
</ol>

<h1 id="internal_review">1. Asking for an internal review <a class="hover_a" href="#internal_review">#</a> </h1>

<p>
   Write back to the department that you are not happy with. Then write a message asking for an internal
    review of your request. You may want to include a link to the
    request page, to make it clear which request you are talking about.
</p>

<p>The internal review has the same target response times as a request for information. According to the Guidelines, it "should be considered by a directorate officer at 
least one rank senior to the officer who made the original decision".
</p>

<h1 id="complaining">2. Complaining to the Information Commissioner <a class="hover_a" href="#complaining">#</a> </h1>

<p>If you are still unhappy after the department has done their
internal review, then you can complain to the Ombudsman. To do so, please visit <a href="http://www.ombudsman.hk/">the website of the Ombudsman</a>.
</p>

<p>To make it easier to send the relevant information to the
Ombudsman, either
    include a link to your request on opengov.hk
in your complaint or print out the whole page of your request and all attachments.
</p>

<p>Opengov.hk has no special facilities for handling a request at this stage - it
passes into the Ombudsman's system.</p>

<p>If you reach this point, you should accept that you won't get the information quickly by this means. Maybe
you want to help the fight to improve Code on Access to Information, or maybe
getting the information slowly is still worthwhile. You can also try and
get the information by <strong>other means...</strong></p>

<h1 id="other_means">3. Using other means to answer your question <a class="hover_a" href="#other_means">#</a> </h1>

<p>You can try pursuing your problem or your research in other ways.

<ul>
<li>Make a <strong>new request</strong> for summary information, or for
documentation relating indirectly to matters in your refused request.
<li>If any <strong>other departments</strong> or publicly owned companies are involved,
then make requests to them.</li>
<li>Write to <strong>your Legco member</strong> or other politician and ask for their help
finding the answer. They can write directly to relevant departments, and
can ask questions in the Legislative Council.</li>
<li>Ask <strong>other researchers</strong> who are interested in a similar
issue to yours for ideas. There may be an Internet
forum or group that they hang out in. </li>
</ul>
