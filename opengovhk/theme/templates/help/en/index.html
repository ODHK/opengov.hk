<h2>General Information about opengov.hk</h2>

<p>(with thanks to whatdotheyknow.com for providing the structure and suggested answers for these help pages)</p>

<h3>What is opengov.hk for? <a href="#purpose">#</a></h3>
<p>
To help you find information the Hong Kong government already holds, via its <a href="http://www.access.gov.hk/">Code on Access to Information</a>. Although not statuory, civil servants are required to follow the Code, and the <a href="www.ombudsman.hk">Ombudsman</a> ensures the Code is properly applied.
</p>

<h3>How does the site work? <a href="#premise">#</a> </h3>
<p>You choose the department that you would like information from, then
write a brief note describing what you want to know. We then send your request
to the department. Any response received is automatically published on the
website for you and anyone else to find and read.
</p>

<h3>Why would I bother to do this? <a href="#whybother_me">#</a> </h3>
<p>You pay taxes, and then government does things with the money. All sorts of
things that affect your life, from health care through to national defence. Some
it does badly, some it does well. The more we find out about how government
works, the better able we are to make suggestions to improve the things that
are done badly, and to celebrate the things that are done well.
Some people also use the site for research.
</p>

<h3>Why would the department bother to reply? <a href="#whybother_them">#</a> </h3>
<p>Under the Code on Access to Information, they have to respond. The response
will either contain the information you want, or a reason why
it has not been provided.
